This was a mod I made for SA2 that made the lighting in Iron Gate and Lost Colony resemble how it did in the GameCube version more.

However, it was only a quick fix and didn't correct the underlying problem (Eggman's flashlight spanning the entire stage) because I couldn't figure out how to do it. What I did was looked like a big improvement to vanilla though, hence "Presentable".

It's now obsolete: The problem was [fixed properly](https://gamebanana.com/mods/397234) by Exant in 2022, which was then incorporated into Shaddatic's [Render Fixes](https://gamebanana.com/mods/452445) mod in 2024.
